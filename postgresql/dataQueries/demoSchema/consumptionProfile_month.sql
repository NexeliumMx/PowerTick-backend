 * Brief: SQL script for querying and computing energy consumption (Wh/VArh) in 1-day intervals over the past 30 days.
 * Date: 2025-02-20
 *
 * Description:
 * This script queries the demo.measurements table to compute the consumption of real energy and reactive energy 
 * for each day in the past 30 days. It ensures that the requesting user has access to the specified powermeter ('DEMO0000001')
 * by joining with the demo.powermeters and demo.user_clients tables. All measurement timestamps are converted to the powermeter's 
 * local time zone, truncated to the day boundary, and formatted for clear output.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Code Description:
 * 1. Joins: The query joins the measurements (m) table with the powermeters (p) and user_clients (uc) tables to verify that
 *    the requesting user is authorized to access data for the specified powermeter.
 *
 * 2. Time Zone Conversion: Each measurement's timestamp is converted from UTC to the powermeter's local time using the 'AT TIME ZONE' clause.
 *
 * 3. Daily Aggregation: The converted timestamp is truncated to the day boundary and formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' to display the date in local time.
 *
 * 4. Consumption Calculation: For each day, the query calculates the difference between the oldest and newest measurements 
 *    for both real energy (total_real_energy_imported) and reactive energy (total_var_hours_imported_q1).
 *
 * 5. Filtering: The query limits results to measurements taken within the past 30 days, based on the powermeter's local time.
 *
 * 6. Grouping and Ordering: Data is grouped by the powermeterâ€™s time zone and the local day, and ordered in descending order so that the most recent day appears first.
 *
 * Example:
 * WHERE user_id = '4c7c56fe-99fc-4611-b57a-0d5683f9bc95' AND serial_number = 'DEMO0000001'
